# Drag-and-Drop List

A simple and intuitive drag-and-drop list interface built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project allows users to reorder list items effortlessly by dragging and dropping them.

## Demo

Check out the live demo [here](https://samuel-m10.github.io/Drag-and-Drop-List/).

## Features

- **Intuitive Drag-and-Drop**: Allows users to reorder list items by dragging them.
- **Interactive UI**: Clean and minimal design for a seamless user experience.
- **Lightweight and Responsive**: Built with plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for quick loading and adaptability.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Markup structure for the list.
- **CSS**: Styling for a modern and responsive layout.
- **JavaScript**: Enables drag-and-drop functionality.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/samuel-m10/Drag-and-Drop-List.git
    ```
2. Navigate into the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd Drag-and-Drop-List
    ```
3. Open `index.html` in your browser:
    ```bash
    open index.html
    ```

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: Contains the HTML markup.
- `styles.css`: Contains the CSS for styling.
- `script.js`: JavaScript logic for drag-and-drop functionality.

## How it Works

1. Each list item has an event listener for drag start, drag over, and drag end.
2. During the drag operation, items can be moved up or down the list.
3. When the item is dropped, the order updates, reflecting the user's changes.
